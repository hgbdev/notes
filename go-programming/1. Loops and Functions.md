# Loops and Functions

## Exercise: Loops and Functions

As a way to play with functions and loops, let's implement a square root function: given a number x, we want to find the number z for which zÂ² is most nearly x.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
	z := x / 2

	for math.Abs(z*z-x) > 0.0000000000001 {
		z -= (z*z - x) / (2 * z)
	}

	return z

}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Sqrt(2))
}

```
