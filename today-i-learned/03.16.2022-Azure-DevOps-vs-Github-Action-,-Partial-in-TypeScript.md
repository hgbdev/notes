# 03.16.2022 - Azure DevOps vs Github Actions, Partial in TypeScript

## Azure DevOps vs Github Action

Ref: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/devops-for-aspnet-developers/actions-vs-pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/devops-for-aspnet-developers/actions-vs-pipelines)

Today I wondered when I thought about Azure DevOps and Github Actions, which are better and what I should use for a long time in my next project. However, I have used both tools, one for my side project and one for my job, and both are doing well with the requirements.

## Partial in TypeScript

Ref: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) 

> Constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to optional. This utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given type.
> 

Under the hood **Partial**

```tsx
/**
 * Make all properties in T optional
 */
type Partial<T> = {
    [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};
```
